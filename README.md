# TextFilterForUserRecords
Group project developed for the Language Theory and Compilation course, where we implemented a text filter for a list of user records. Developed together with [Jo√£o Pedro Gomes](https://github.com/JoaoPedro9400) and [Ricardo Correia](https://github.com/ricardocorreia99).

Implemented in Python using regular expressions, with the [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) module.
